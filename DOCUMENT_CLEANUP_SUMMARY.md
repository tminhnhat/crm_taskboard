2. **File Storage**: Integrate with cloud storage for better file management
3. **Template Management**: Add UI for template upload and management
4. **Audit Logging**: Add comprehensive audit trail
5. **Batch Operations**: Support for bulk document generation
6. **Preview Functionality**: Add document preview capabilities

### Monitoring
1. Add logging for document operations
2. Monitor file system usage
3. Track document generation performance
4. Monitor email sending success rates

## Configuration Required

### Environment Variables
```env
# SMTP Configuration (for email functionality)
SMTP_HOST=your-smtp-host
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USER=your-smtp-user
SMTP_PASS=your-smtp-password
SMTP_SECURE=false
SMTP_FROM=your-from-email

# Blob Storage (for templates)
BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN=your-vercel-blob-token
```

### Database Migration
Run the updated `document_tables.sql` migration to apply the schema improvements.

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test document generation for all supported types
2. Verify email functionality with different providers
3. Test file deletion and cleanup
4. Validate error handling scenarios
5. Performance test with large files
6. Security test file upload/download paths

This cleanup significantly improves the robustness, security, and maintainability of the document management system.

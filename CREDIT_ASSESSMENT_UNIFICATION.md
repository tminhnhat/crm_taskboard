# Credit Assessment Form Unification - COMPLETED

## Overview
This document outlines the successful unification of MetadataForm functionality into the CreditAssessmentForm for easier maintenance and better code organization.

## ✅ COMPLETED CLEANUP

### 1. Created Unified Component
- **File**: `src/components/CreditAssessmentForm.tsx` (renamed from CreditAssessmentFormUnified.tsx)
- **Purpose**: Combines all MetadataForm functionality directly into the Credit Assessment form
- **Status**: ✅ COMPLETED

### 2. Removed Old Files
- ✅ `src/components/CreditAssessmentForm.tsx` (old version) - REMOVED
- ✅ `src/components/metadata/CreditAssessmentTemplates.ts` - REMOVED  
- ✅ `src/components/metadata/` directory - REMOVED (empty)
- ✅ Old documentation files - REMOVED:
  - `NUMEROLOGY_ENHANCEMENTS.md`
  - `numerology.md` 
  - `22 ĐỊNH NGHĨA FULL - LAM CHU CUOC DOI BANG KHOA HOC SO.docx`
  - `22 ĐỊNH NGHĨA FULL - LAM CHU CUOC DOI BANG KHOA HOC SO.txt`

### 3. Updated References
- ✅ Updated `src/app/assessments/page.tsx` to use clean `CreditAssessmentForm` import
- ✅ Renamed component from `CreditAssessmentFormUnified` to `CreditAssessmentForm`
- ✅ All existing functionality preserved

## Current State

### Files in Production
- `src/components/CreditAssessmentForm.tsx` - **UNIFIED COMPONENT** (contains all templates and logic)
- `src/app/assessments/page.tsx` - Uses the unified component

### Kept Files (Still in Use)
- `src/components/MetadataForm.tsx` - Still used by CollateralForm
- `src/components/JsonInputHelper.tsx` - Used by multiple forms
- `src/lib/numerology.ts` & `src/hooks/useNumerology.ts` - Used by customer management
- `src/components/CollateralForm.tsx` - Uses MetadataForm for collateral metadata

## Component Structure
